# Color Scale Generator

> Work In Progress!

Color Scale Generator is a quick little app to help generate colors on a scale There are other color generators out there such as [hihayk.github.io/scale](https://hihayk.github.io/scale/#4/4/75/75/0/0/0/0/C62617/204/38/23/white) and [colordesigner.io](https://colordesigner.io/gradient-generator/?mode=lch#FBE6E6-27070D) but they didn't do exactly what I wanted. 

This app will let you set however many colors you want, and specify which colors you want fixed and generate all others. I personally like to generate colors from 50, 100-900 for my website styles, and generally speaking from white to black.

I am just starting out on this project, but I chose to use SvelteKit and Tailwind.css to continue learning those technologies.
